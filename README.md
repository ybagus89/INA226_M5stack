# INA226_M5stack

This project demonstrates how to use the M5Stack Core to measure voltage, current, and power with the INA226 sensor.

## Libraries Used

- [M5Stack](https://github.com/m5stack/M5Stack)
- [INA226_asukiaaa](https://github.com/asukiaaa/INA226_asukiaaa) ‚Üê **Required!**

## How to Use

1. **Install the required libraries**  
   - Install [INA226_asukiaaa](https://github.com/asukiaaa/INA226_asukiaaa) via PlatformIO Library Manager or Arduino Library Manager.
   - Install [M5Stack](https://github.com/m5stack/M5Stack) library.

2. **Connect the INA226 sensor to your M5Stack Core**  
   - Default I2C pins for M5Stack Core: SDA = 21, SCL = 22

3. **Build and upload the code to your M5Stack Core.**

4. **View the voltage, current, and power readings on the M5Stack LCD.**
